 🛡️ PhishGuard

Phishing Website Detection System

📌 Project Overview

PhishGuard is a cybersecurity-focused web application designed to detect phishing websites by analyzing URL characteristics and webpage content.
The system helps users identify malicious websites before they enter sensitive information such as passwords, OTPs, or banking details.

Phishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated and often indistinguishable to normal users. PhishGuard acts as a preventive security layer that warns users in real time.

🎯 Problem Statement

Phishing websites mimic legitimate platforms to steal user credentials and sensitive data.
Due to:

Look-alike domains

Fake login pages

Social engineering tactics

users often fail to identify such threats, leading to financial loss and identity theft.

There is a need for an automated, reliable, and fast detection system that can classify websites as legitimate or phishing before damage occurs.

💡 Solution Approach

PhishGuard follows a layered detection architecture:

Accepts a URL as input

Extracts security-relevant features

Analyzes patterns using rule-based logic and/or machine learning

Classifies the website

Warns the user accordingly
